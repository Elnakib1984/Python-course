# Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. 
# Objects get their variables and functions from classes. 
# Classes are essentially a template to create your objects


class Myclass :
  variable = "random"

def function(self):
  print("This is a message inside the class.")


# to assign the above class to an object you would do the following:
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
# Now the variable "myobjectx" holds an object of 
# the class "MyClass" that contains the variable and the function defined within the class called "MyClass".
